# Connecting Openstack to the ELK: Analyzing the Openstack Swift Log

Read this in [Portuguese - BR](README.pt_br.md)

This repository contains the configuration files used for the connection of Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash and Filebeat to Openstack, for the monitoring and log analysis of Openstack Swift, and contains images used in a publication made in Medium. 

To know how to use them, just read [this publication in Medium](https://medium.com/connecting-option-openstack-ao-elk/elk-medium-md-a2d61961c10b) done by me, teaching how and where use each of the configuration files.
